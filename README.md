# MNIST-Classification

This repository contains my attempts to classify the MNIST dataset with various machine learning techniques that were taught in Machine Learning 1 & 2. 
This will be consistently updated with new approaches (RNN's are next). Plan to eventually compare the methods against each other. All done in Python.
